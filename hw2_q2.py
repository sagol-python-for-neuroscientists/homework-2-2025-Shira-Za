def meetup(agent_listing: tuple) -> list:
    """Model the outcome of the meetings of pairs of agents.

    The pairs of agents are ((a[0], a[1]), (a[2], a[3]), ...). If there's an uneven
    number of agents, the last agent will remain the same.

    Notes
    -----
    The rules governing the meetings were described in the question. The outgoing
    listing may change its internal ordering relative to the incoming one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_listing : tuple of Agent
        A listing (tuple in this case) in which each element is of the Agent
        type, containing a 'name' field and a 'category' field, with 'category' being
        of the type Condition.

    Returns
    -------
    updated_listing : list
        A list of Agents with their 'category' field changed according to the result
        of the meeting.
